📉 Customer Churn Prediction – Telco Dataset
🔍 Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn Dataset. By analyzing customer behavior, contract types, and service usage, we build a machine learning model to identify customers at risk of leaving. The goal is to help telecom companies improve retention strategies and customer satisfaction.

🧠 Project Goals
- Understand churn patterns through data exploration and visualization.
- Preprocess and clean the dataset for modeling.
- Identify key features influencing churn.
- Build a predictive model using machine learning.
- Suggest actionable strategies to reduce churn.

📁 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Telco Customer Churn
- Size: ~7,000 customer records
- Features: Demographics, contract type, payment method, tenure, charges, and churn status

🧹 Workflow
1. Data Collection
- Imported CSV file from Kaggle
- Removed sensitive identifiers (e.g., customerID) for privacy
2. Data Preprocessing
  - Handled missing values in TotalCharges
- Converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding
- Normalized numerical features
  3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized churn trends by contract type, payment method, and tenure
- Used heatmaps to explore feature correlations
4. Feature Selection
- Applied Random Forest to rank feature importance
- Selected top predictors for model training
5. Modeling
- Trained classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
6. Insights & Recommendations
- Long-term contracts and auto-pay reduce churn
- High monthly charges and short tenure increase churn risk
- Suggested retention strategies based on findings

📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Python 5
- Power BI (optional dashboard for business insights)
