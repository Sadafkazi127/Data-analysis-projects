💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing transaction patterns and using smart techniques to handle data imbalance, the model helps flag suspicious activity in real-time.
📂 Dataset
We used the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, which contains anonymized transaction records. It includes both normal and fraudulent transactions.
⚠️ All data handling follows privacy and security guidelines to ensure compliance.


🎯 Project Goals
1. Data Collection
- Load the dataset into Python.
- Make sure sensitive information is protected.
2. Data Exploration
- Find out what percentage of transactions are fraudulent.
- Spot unusual transaction amounts using visual tools.
3. Data Preprocessing
- Use SMOTE to balance the dataset (since fraud cases are rare).
- Normalize numerical features to improve model accuracy.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Create histograms and boxplots to understand transaction patterns.
- Check how different features relate to each other.
5. Feature Selection
- Use feature importance methods to focus on the most useful indicators of fraud.

🤖 Model Goal
Build an AI model that can:
- Learn from past transaction data.
- Detect and flag potentially fraudulent transactions in real-time.

📊 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- SMOTE from imbalanced-learn
- Jupyter Notebook for development

🚀 How to Run
- Clone this repo
- Install required libraries
- Run the notebook step-by-step
- Check model performance and predictions

📈 Results
The model was trained and evaluated using metrics like:
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Curve
